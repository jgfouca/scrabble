/**
 * This class represents a single search through the dictionary. The
 * search is constrained by string that is similar to a regular expression.
 * Unlike regular expressions, these strings come with a set of external
 * state. This search language is defined here:
 * 
 *************** SEARCH LANGUAGE DEFINITION ************************
 * 
 * Constraints are primary defined by their reg-expr string. We use our own special reg-expr
 * language here. The allowed characters are:
 * '*'     -> Matches any character 0 or more times.
 * '[A-Z]' -> Matches the exact character specified
 * '#'     -> Matches any character 1 time that is compatible with a secondary word
 * '_'     -> Matches any character 1 time.
 *
 * Rules:
 * -> '*' may only occur at the beginning and/or end of the reg-expr
 * -> Each '*' must have a corresponding item in the max_lengths vector specifying the maximum number
 *    of characters the '*' can match
 * -> Each '#' must have a corresponding item in the req_sets vector. This item specifies
 *    the word and the index where the new character will go.
 * -> A reg-expr cannot contain any character outside the set of allowed characters.
 *
 * Constraints are intended to represent the requirements a word needs to pass in order to
 * be placeable in a specific location.
 *
 ********************** KEY CONCEPTS ********************************
 * 
 * "Compatibility" - in scrabble, not only do the letters along your primary play-line
 * have to be a valid word, but any secondary words that get formed by the play
 * must be words as well. We express this concept as compatibility and we use
 * the '#' character to represent this in a reg expr. The '#' comes with extra
 * bagage: it will have set<char> in the requirement-sets vector.
 * For example, say we have the reg_expr "*#_A*" and the compatibility pair:
 * (3, "CA#"). This means that, for whatever word we chose to satisfy "*#_A*, the
 * character of the word that happens to fall in the # location must also be
 * compatible with "CA#" when it is ALSO inserted in the # location of that word.
 * We optimize this process by pre-computing all possible valid letters for 
 * "CA#" and storing them in a set. This will avoid expensive dictionary searches
 * in the critical path of the program.
 *
 * We consider each part of the reg-expr that is associated with a 
 * "highly-constrained square" to be a "difficult component" of the reg expr.
 * Highly-constrained squares are places on the board that either have a piece
 * played on them, or are immediately adjacent to a square with a piece on it.
 * In the reg_expr, the former will be [A-Z] and the latter '#'. The other 
 * pieces of a reg_expr ('*', '_') we call "easy components" and are correlated
 * with "unconstrained squares".  
 * 
 * Each constraint has a "mandatory section". This is the part of the reg-expr which
 * MUST be matched in order for a word to meet the constraint. For example, for
 * reg-expr "*E*", the mandatory section is simply "E". For "*_#E_*" the mandatory
 * section is "_#E_". Simplifying things, the mandatory section is the reg-expr
 * with the '*' components removed. 
 *
 * Each constraint has a "critical square". This is the square around which the
 * prospective move is centered. No matter how much the constraint is "eased"
 * (see below), it will always include the critical square. See the AI-player
 * documentation for more on critical squares. 
 *
 * We need to have a way of making a constraint easier to satisfy in the case that
 * we find no matching words for the original constraint. We use a tree-based
 * algorithm when R, L children are formed by removing the rightmost or leftmost
 * difficult component. We can iterate over the easings by having a simple 
 * way of converting a number into a set of R,L moves. 
 *
 *********************** OTHER INFO *********************************
 *
 * In order to give some help to whomever has to place this word, if a
 * word satisfies the constraint, we will also determine the locations
 * of all valid placements of this word. In order to convey this
 * information, we need a point of reference. We will use the first
 * item in the mandatory section of the search std::string as this
 * point of reference. So, if the search std::string is "*THE*" and
 * the word is "LOATHE", then we will add -3 to the
 * potential_placements std::vector.
