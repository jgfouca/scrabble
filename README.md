Scrabble/Words with friends program + artificial intelligence (AI)

This project is for scrabble/words with friends enthusiasts. It supports human vs. human, 
human vs. AI, and AI vs. AI modes. The human interface is a bit clunky, so the primary use 
case revolves around the AIs. This program can be used as a platform for evaluating AIs with
various tunings and strategies. The command-mode can also "help you" (cheat) in your meatspace
scrabble games or words with friends games on your phone/ipad.
