/**
 * This class implements a scrabble-player that can find good (hopefully) moves
 * automatically. The most difficult code in the program is the make_play
 * method of this class.
 *
 * The algorithm for making a play is described here (at a high-level):
 * 1) Loop over every square on the board. Any square that has a piece on it
 *    is a piece around which we can potentially make moves.
 * 2) There are at most, 6 possible play-lines around a played-piece, we find
 *    out which of these is viable.
 * 3) We loop over each viable-play line, encoding the possible plays along this
 *    line that have a reasonable chance of success into Constraint objects.
 * 4) We loop over these Constraint object, seeing if any words in the dictionary
 *    that we can make satisfies the constraint. If so, we score the word; if
 *    this score is the best yet seen, we save the play.
 *
 * The algorithm for checking satisfiability of an individual constraint is also
 * fairly interesting. The need for this piece of the program to run fast is
 * essential.
 * 1) We start with the ~200,000 words in the dictionary. We need to find the
 *    ones that satisfy the constraint. The strategy is to apply cheap "filters"
 *    first to efficiently narrow down the set of potential words.
 * 2) The first filter is based on word-length. Obviously, a 10-letter word
 *    won't satisfy "_#_" and a 2-letter word won't satisfy "*#__#AS__#*"
 * 3) The second filter is based on bitmaps. We encode the letters that must be
 *    present in a word into a bitmap, then we encode the candidate word into
 *    another bitmap. If the first bitmap is not a subset of the second bitmap,
 *    the candidate will not satisfy the constraint. For example, the reg_expr
 *    "*THE*" will have a bitmap with '1' in the T,H, and E position. The word
 *    "TRUTH" will have a bitmap with '1' in the T,R,U, and H positions. "TRUTH"
 *    cannot possibly satisfy "*THE*" because it has no 'E'. The bitmap check
 *    detects this because the subset check will fail.
 * 4) The third filter is called the "possible-formulation" filter. We check to
 *    see if, given the mandatory-letters and the letters in the AI-player's
 *    tray, can the candidate word be formed. In the AI_Player constructor,
 *    one of the front-loaded computations is creating a vector of letter-counts
 *    for each dicitionary word and a vector of indeces pointing to non-zero
 *    items in the letter-count vector. We loop over the >0 letter counts and
 *    see if the AI-player has at least that many letters of that value available.
 * 5) If the candidate word has passed all these filters, we send it off to the
 *    Constraint to make the fairly expensive computation of if/how the word
 *    satisfies the constraint.
